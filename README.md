# Sensei (teacher in japanese)

Sensei is an online app made in order to make you learn japanese words and their usages

# How does it work?

You get a word in hiragana/katakana and then write it out in romaji to train your understanding of hiragana/katakana.

Then you convert the romaji back to hiragana

The last question is what does the word mean, one of the glossary words is enough to get it right
