# Sensei (teacher in japanese)

Sensei is an online app made in order to make you learn japanese words and their usages

# How does it work?

You get a word in hiragana/katakana and then write it out in romaji to train your understanding of hiragana/katakana.

After this, if the word is a kanji, you get to see the kanji and you write it out in hiragana/katakana.

You also get examples of how to use this word in a sentence.
